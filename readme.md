# The Nice Gadget website - Backend repo

The backend repository complements the front end of the Nice Gadget website, providing essential server-side functionalities. Key features include:

- **Database Management**: Utilizes PostgreSQL as the database management system for storing product information, user data, and session details.
- **ORM Framework**: Employs Prisma for efficient database access and management through its modern and type-safe ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) capabilities.
- **API Development**: Built with Express.js, offering a robust and flexible framework for developing RESTful APIs to handle user authentication, product retrieval, and cart management.
- **Development Tools**: Integrated Eslint and Prettier for code linting and formatting, ensuring code consistency and adherence to best practices. Husky and lint-staged are utilized for pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality standards.
- **Type Safety**: Developed using TypeScript to leverage static typing and enhance code readability, maintainability, and scalability.

## Backend Technologies:

- **Prisma**: Utilized for ORM functionalities, facilitating seamless interaction with the PostgreSQL database.
- **PostgreSQL**: Chosen as the relational database management system for its reliability, performance, and robust feature set.
- **Express.js**: Selected as the backend framework for its simplicity, flexibility, and extensive middleware support, enabling rapid API development.
- **Eslint and Prettier**: Integrated for consistent code styling and formatting across the project, promoting code quality and maintainability.
- **Husky**: Employed for setting up Git hooks to automate pre-commit checks and enforce code quality standards.
- **Typescript**: Utilized to bring static typing and advanced tooling to JavaScript, enhancing developer productivity and code robustness.
- **Lint-staged**: Configured to run linters on staged files, ensuring that only lint-free code is committed to the repository.
